# Midterm Project - Phase 1: Sketch a visual object using primitive shapes

## how to draw

- The background will be black, the object will be white 
    - ->from phase 3 the objects will be random colored)
- The main figure consists of an ellipse for head, a long rectangle with three lines for theeth
    - ->in phase 2 I changed to arc for head, and 4 rectangles for each of teeth
    - ->all the teeth changed to be tilted in phase 2
- 1 triangle for the nose, filled with black
- 2 circles for the eyes, filled with black
