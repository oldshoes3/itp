| Chapter | One thing I new | One thing I didn't know |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. The way of the program | Programmers keep greeting world. | Parsing is a process of figuring out the structure in language. |
| 3. Functions | In Pythong, statements are run one at a time, from top to bottom. | Linux started from a simple program to examine an Intel chip. |
| 5. Conditionals and recursion | In Python, equal sign is ==, not =. | Having a function that calls itself is called recursion, and it looks like loops without loop statements. |
| 10. Lists | In Python, lists are mutable so we can update elements, add new elements, delete elements, slice the lists, etc. | Two lists created with the same values are equivalent, but not identical. By refering they can be identical?, which is called aliasing. |
