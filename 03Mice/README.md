# Mice

## What?
- a python file ({Seol}mice.py) that prints following:

		3
			Blind
				Mice


- Having a calculation for 3
    - 1 / 2 * 3 / 4 * 5 / 6 * 7 / 8 * 9 / 10 * 11 / 12 * 13 / 14 * 15 -> round off

## How?
- print function
    - 3 - (new line)
    - (tap) - 'Blind' - (new line)
    - (tap) - (tap) - 'Mice'

- put the above formula instead of 3
- (new line) -> \n
- (tap) -> \t

## problem
If the file is in the github repository and run it, the error (can't find '__main__' module in ...) shows up. If the file is in other folder in my laptop, it runs without error.
