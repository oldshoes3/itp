# Mice

## What?
- a python file ({Seol}mice.py) that prints following:

		3
			Blind
				Mice


- Having a calculation for 3 -> just (5 - 2)

## How?
- 3 - (new line)
- (tap) - 'Blind' - (new line)
- (tap) - (tap) - 'Mice'

- put 5 - 2 instead of 3 -> maybe more complex calculation?
- (new line) -> \n
- (tap) -> \t

## problem
If the file is in the github repository and run it, the error (can't find '__main__' module in ...) shows up. If the file is in other folder in my laptop, it runs without error.
