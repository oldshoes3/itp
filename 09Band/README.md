- I took the job of making the basic format of html. Since I forgot tags like p, div, br, etc, I got stuck and didn't know how to start. I copied the source code of [rdwrome.github.io](rdwrome.github.io) and started modifying it. started figuring out what each tag is.

- Sharing repository is the biggest problem we encountered. One time I push push button and Neil's working got trouble to be removed. Angel made him copy the whole code and made a new file, and push it and made me pull that new file.

- self-assessment
    - To be honest I did the least amount of work. I took basic formatting of index.html file and I just modified from Rachael's website source code. Even Angel later cleaned up the code.

- assessment of my group members
    - Neil found brilliant ideas with the text content. He also found all the images and audio.
    - Angel seems experienced with making website already. He smoothly made css file, and he cleaned up all indentation and other stuff of my html format. He further edited like image sizes, audio bar size, background color, etc.
