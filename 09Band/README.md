# Band

<pre>
Every group member submits an individual markdown file to Canvas. The markdown file
must include:
- A hyperlink to the site you all made ON THE INTERNET
- Problems faced, decisions made (as in other weeks)
- A self-assessment of how you contributed to the group
- Short assessments of your group members and the contributions they made
